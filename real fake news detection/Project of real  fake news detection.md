​	This project used __tfidfvectorizer__ in sklearn to vectorizer the data, and logistic regression, rnn, decision tree, nn, and QDA as classifier to predict whether if the news is fake or not.





​	In addition, I also fine tune a model with based on BERT, but the model doesn't show a dramatic increase in acc than the traditional machine learning method. I believe this is because the task is not complicated enough, so the power of deep learning nn can not be shown here.
